<p class="message">
  Welcome to my academic website! Here, you’ll find information about my research, projects, and interests. Feel free to explore and reach out if you have questions.
</p>

I’m Antonio Aguirre, a 4th-year PhD candidate in Statistics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My research is focused on developing scalable Bayesian models for phenomena that evolve over time and exhibit extreme behavior during certain periods. 

## Research Interests

I’m particularly interested in:
- **Dynamic Quantile Linear Models (DQLMs):** Exploring real-time quantile-based forecasting methods for environmental and hydrological applications.
- **Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning:** Integrating probabilistic modeling with advanced computational techniques for forecasting and inference.
- **Spatio-Temporal Processes:** Understanding complex data dynamics in space and time, with applications in environmental science, economics, and public health.
- **Continual Statistical Post-Processing:** Developing adaptive methods to improve predictions over time.

## Projects

Some of my ongoing and past projects include:
- **Forecast Correction and Synthesis:** Improving predictive accuracy by combining outputs from different climate models.
- **GDPC Analysis of Climate Indices:** Analyzing dynamic relationships among meteorological indices using Generalized Dynamic Principal Components.
- **TA Training Workshops:** Designing interactive workshops that emphasize accessibility, equity-minded teaching, and active learning.

## Background

Before starting my PhD, I earned:
- **MSc in Economic Theory**  
- **BSc in Applied Mathematics**

These foundations have provided me with strong analytical skills and a passion for solving real-world problems through statistical modeling and data analysis.

## Fun Facts

- I’m originally from Mexico and enjoy exploring my cultural heritage.  
- In my free time, I like learning German and working out.
