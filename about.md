<p class="message">
  Welcome to my academic corner—a space dedicated to my research, teaching, and exploration of Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and more.
</p>

I’m Antonio Aguirre, a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My work centers on creating scalable Bayesian models to analyze evolving phenomena, focusing on extreme behavior and uncertainty quantification. I aim to tackle complex problems in environmental science, hydrology, and beyond by blending statistical rigor with computational efficiency.

## Research Focus

I strive to bridge theory and application through innovative statistical methods. My key research areas include:

- **Bayesian Statistics & Machine Learning**  
   Integrating probabilistic frameworks with machine learning to develop predictive models for high-dimensional and dynamic systems.  

- **Dynamic Quantile Linear Models (DQLMs)**  
   Advancing real-time, quantile-based forecasting techniques, particularly in hydrology and environmental science.  

- **Spatio-Temporal Modeling**  
   Capturing and understanding data patterns across space and time to uncover meaningful insights for policy and decision-making.  

- **Continual Learning in Statistical Post-Processing**  
   Designing adaptive methods to improve forecast accuracy over time through efficient model updates.

## Ongoing Projects

Some of my recent and ongoing projects include:

- **Real-Time Forecast Synthesis**  
   Combining outputs from diverse climate models to achieve robust and accurate predictions.  

- **Dynamic Principal Components for Climate Indices**  
   Analyzing interdependencies among meteorological indices to improve climate forecasts.  

- **TA Professional Development**  
   Creating active learning workshops to train TAs in accessibility-focused and equity-minded teaching techniques.

## Academic Journey

My academic foundations are rooted in a diverse quantitative background:  

- **M.Sc. in Economic Theory**  
- **B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics**  

These experiences have honed my analytical skills and deepened my appreciation for solving real-world problems with data.

## Beyond Research

When I’m not immersed in statistics, you’ll likely find me:

- Reflecting on philosophical questions, particularly those surrounding epistemology and the nature of uncertainty.  
- Experimenting with new tools and technologies to push the boundaries of what data-driven insights can achieve.  
- Working out or learning German—my latest endeavor in personal growth.
