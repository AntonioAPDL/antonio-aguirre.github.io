<p class="message">
  Welcome to my academic corner—a space dedicated to my research, teaching, and exploration of Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and more.
</p>

I’m Antonio Aguirre, a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My work centers on creating scalable Bayesian models to analyze phenomena that evolve over time, with a focus on extreme behavior and uncertainty quantification. By blending statistical rigor with computational efficiency, I aim to tackle complex problems in environmental science, hydrology, and beyond.

## Research Focus

I strive to bridge theory and application through innovative statistical methods. My key research areas include:

- **Bayesian Statistics & Machine Learning**  
   Integrating probabilistic frameworks with machine learning to develop predictive models for high-dimensional and dynamic systems.  

- **Dynamic Quantile Linear Models (DQLMs)**  
   Advancing real-time, quantile-based forecasting techniques, particularly in hydrology and environmental science.  

- **Spatio-Temporal Modeling**  
   Capturing and understanding data patterns across space and time to uncover meaningful insights for policy and decision-making.  

- **Continual Learning in Statistical Post-Processing**  
   Designing adaptive methods to improve forecast accuracy over time through efficient model updates.

## Ongoing Projects

Some of my recent and ongoing projects include:

- **Real-Time Forecast Synthesis**  
   Combining outputs from diverse climate models to achieve robust and accurate predictions.  

- **Dynamic Principal Components for Climate Indices**  
   Analyzing interdependencies among meteorological indices to improve climate forecasts.  

- **TA Professional Development**  
   Creating active learning workshops to train TAs in accessibility-focused and equity-minded teaching techniques.

## Academic Journey

My academic foundations are rooted in a diverse quantitative background:  

- **M.Sc. in Economic Theory**  
- **B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics**  

These experiences have honed my analytical skills and deepened my appreciation for solving real-world problems with data.

## Beyond Research

When I’m not immersed in statistics, you’ll likely find me:

- Reflecting on philosophical questions, particularly those surrounding epistemology and the nature of uncertainty.  
- Experimenting with new tools and technologies to push the boundaries of what data-driven insights can achieve.  
- Working out or learning German—my latest endeavor in personal growth.

## Support My Work ☕️

Hi, I’m Antonio—a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics, which means I model chaos for fun and occasionally make sense of it. If I’ve helped you survive stats, buy me a coffee—it’s cheaper than therapy.
